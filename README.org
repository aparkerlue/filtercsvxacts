+Filter CSV transactions that are not present in a repository.+

+This command accepts a CSV file of financial transactions and prints
records that are not found in a repository of CSV files.+

This project is in development.  Right now it parses [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180][RFC 4180]] CSV
files and prints their contents.  For example, using [[https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/][Stack]]:
#+begin_example
$ cat <<EOF >example.csv; stack run example.csv
"a b",c
"Foxy Badger",2
Dreary Hog,1
EOF
a b|c
Foxy Badger|2
Dreary Hog|1
#+end_example
