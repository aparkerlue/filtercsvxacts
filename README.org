#+TITLE: filtercsvxacts

Filter CSV transactions that are not present in a repository.

This command accepts a CSV file of financial transactions and prints
records that are not found in a repository of CSV files.  Its usage:
#+begin_example
filtercsvxacts CSV-FILE-WITH-NOVEL-RECORDS [REPOSITORY-CSV-FILE]...
#+end_example
Records in the first argument that are already present in the
repository are excluded.  Duplicate records are accounted for.

You can pass directories in place of files, in which case the command
walks directories for CSV files.  All CSV file names must include the
suffix ~.csv~.

filtercsvxacts parses [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180][RFC 4180]] CSV files and prints their contents.
It tolerates [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline][LF]] alone as a record separator, recognizes quoted
substrings within fields, and assumes that the CSV document includes a
header.  For example, using [[https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/][Stack]]:
#+begin_example
$ echo -n '
№,Name
1,Foxy Badger
2,"""Dreary"" Hog"
3,"Furry
 Walrus"
4,Absent "Owl, Esq."
' | tail -n +2 >example.csv && stack run example.csv
№,Name
1,Foxy Badger
2,"""Dreary"" Hog"
3,"Furry
 Walrus"
4,"Absent Owl, Esq."
#+end_example
